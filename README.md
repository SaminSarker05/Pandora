# Pandora
will create a 64 bit cpu


- implement ALU, registers, and Control Unit to emulate CPU
- write instructions to do operations using CPU - generate FIbb numbers, bubble sort

Control Unit
fetch instructions from RAM, decode and send signals to ALU

ALU
logical operations (NOT, AND, XOR, OR, BIT SHIFT)
arithemtic operations

Memory (Registers)
primary or temporary data
